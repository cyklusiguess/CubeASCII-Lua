## about

this project is a complete **lua rewrite** of the original cubeascii project by [tucna](https://github.com/tucna/Programming_Projects/blob/main/C%2B%2B/CubeASCII.cpp).

created by **IAmCyklus**, this was made **primarily for fun and learning purposes** in lua. it has been tested within **Psych Engine**, but it may work in other lua interpreters with slight modifications.

## please note:

- this was created while i was still learning lua. the code is functional, but **not perfect**.
- the cube’s **shape and camera are delicate** – modifying core logic may break the visuals.
- the shading system is **not fully functional**, and most characters in the gradient don’t display as expected.

---

## how to run

you **must run this in a terminal** in order to see the cube animation. the script relies on terminal behavior such as cursor control and `io.write()`.

---

## requirements

- lua interpreter (e.g., lua 5.3+)
- terminal or emulator with support for ansi escape codes (for cursor control)
- optional: psych engine or other game environments with lua support

---

## tested in

- [psych engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine)
- unix/linux terminals
- windows terminal (with some tweaks)
